# Berlin's Stolpersteine
 
This is a data analysis project about Berlin's Stolpersteine, which commemorate Nazi victims of the Nazi era. I scraped the data from website of the [Koordinierungsstelle Stolpersteine Berlin](https://www.stolpersteine-berlin.de/) to get the data of all Stolpersteine of Berlin, then cleaned and then analyzed it. I also added geo coded info, so that the locations of the Stolpersteine can be visualized in a map. The results can be viewed interactively with [Shiny](https://raupy.shinyapps.io/Berlins-Stolpersteine).
